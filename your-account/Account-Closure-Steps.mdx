Canceling your account can be done anytime in **Preferences \> Profile** by clicking **Delete Account** at the page’s bottom and following the guided prompts.

Be sure to download any needed analytics or reports first, as closure instantly removes dashboard access and deletes all site data. After deletion, recovery is not possible, and all information (except for required compliance records) is erased from the system

## Information on Data Deletion and Retention

## Data Deleted Immediately

- All analytics site content and account details are permanently erased.
- Any active subscriptions are canceled.
- Saved billing information, such as credit card details in Stripe, is deleted.

## Data Retained

- Payment transaction records in Stripe remain for compliance with tax obligations.

Currently, accounts cannot be temporarily paused or suspended—they may only be deleted.
