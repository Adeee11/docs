title: "Upgrading or downgrading"

Plans can be adjusted at any time as data traffic changes. Access **Preferences \> Profile \> Billing** to choose a package in line with analytics needs. Feel free to upgrade whenever it suits, and for downgrades, reach out to support for help.

Plans are designed to correspond to typical traffic volume; for example, a high-traffic site must use a plan with sufficient monthly views. When going over plan limits, review the platform’s plan limit policies—service will continue seamlessly until a change is made.
