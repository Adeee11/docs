At Floo Analytics, fairness, clarity, and simplicity are our core principles when it comes to payments and subscriptions. Our aim is to give every customer a hassle-free experience with transparent billing and easy-to-understand policies.

**All charges are processed through the payment details saved in your account.** You have the flexibility to pick either a monthly or an annual payment schedule. Choosing the yearly subscription unlocks 17% savings. Your first payment is triggered automatically 31 days after you create an account, following your free trial, unless you decide to cancel beforehand.

## Frequently Asked Billing Questions

## How is my payment schedule determined?

When you open a Floo Analytics account—for instance, on March 20th—your first subscription charge is due on April 19th, the day your 31-day free trial ends. Whether you select monthly or annual billing, renewals will occur on this anniversary date.

- **Monthly:** After your initial charge, your subscription renews every month on the corresponding calendar day. If you start on March 20th, you’ll be billed on the 19th of each following month.
- **Annual:** For yearly plans, you will be charged on the same date each year. As your renewal approaches, we’ll send you a reminder email so you know ahead of time when the next payment is about to be processed.

We want you to feel in control—your subscription and billing preferences can be managed directly in your Floo Analytics dashboard. If you have questions or want to make changes, our team is always here to help.

## Can I manage multiple sites within Floo Analytics?

Absolutely\! Create unlimited sites under one account, with overall page views across all sites counting toward your plan’s usage total. Each subscription includes space for up to fifty sites at no added cost, with options for expanding further for a modest fee.

## Can I move between monthly and annual billing?

Yes—switch between monthly and yearly payments or even adjust your plan tier whenever your needs change. If you change payment frequency partway through your subscription, any unused balance will be credited back to your account and automatically deducted from future charges. For example, if you prepaid yearly, then convert to monthly after one cycle, the remaining annual amount will be used as monthly credits until it’s spent.

## Are budget plans available?

Floo Analytics prioritizes performance and data privacy by providing robust tools on secure cloud infrastructure, not low-cost hosting. Every plan includes full access to analytics features such as automated email reports and custom filters. Subscription costs reflect both sustainability and ongoing product improvement, ensuring clients receive lasting value.

## Are discounts available?

Floo Analytics does not routinely provide promotional discounts, aside from a referral-based credit and the 17% annual plan price reduction. Uniform pricing ensures that all clients receive the same value for their subscription.

## Is there special pricing for charities?

Registered nonprofit organizations involved in sustainability or social equity initiatives are encouraged to reach out for consideration of specially tailored rates.

## Which payments are accepted?

Only credit card payments processed securely through Stripe on our platform can be accepted; alternate payment types aren’t supported at this time, ensuring streamlined and secure billing integration.

## What happens when I cancel my Floo Analytics account?

Account closure is instant and final according to Floo Analytics’ policies, with refunds not available unless required by law. To maximize your subscription’s value, consider closing your account just before the next billing cycle.

## Why was my card charged?

Charges occur when an account is created and remain active until canceled. If an account wasn’t set up intentionally and charges appear, this may indicate unauthorized use—contact Floo Analytics support right away for assistance.

## How do I access my invoices?

Invoices can be viewed or downloaded in the dashboard by navigating to **Preferences \> Profile \> Billing**. For alternate recipients, their email addresses can be added in the billing settings; use commas to separate multiple contacts.
