title: "Add or delete a site"

Floo Analytics accounts allow users to **add or delete a site** at any time, supporting up to 50 sites per account at no extra cost. This lets you track multiple websites simultaneously and easily **share those dashboards** or **email reports** with any client, customer, or collaborator who needs access.

When **sharing a site or sites**, each shared site remains separate from your other managed sites. For example, if you’ve created a site called **LunaStonks**, you can share its dashboard with a client, but **they cannot see your other sites** unless you explicitly share those as well. This privacy also applies when sending **email reports**—each report is site-specific, so recipients only receive details relevant to the selected site.\

You can share dashboards or reports for multiple sites with a single person, and future updates will introduce **user accounts** for more advanced sharing features.

## Instructions for Creating a Site

To set up a new site or add another workspace:

1. Navigate to the **Preferences** section.
2. Select **Websites**.
3. Choose **Create new** found at the page header.
4. Enter a title for the site—this can be any label for internal tracking.
5. Copy the integration code and insert it where you need it.

Once a site is created, a unique site identifier is generated for use with integration tools. The new site appears in the list under **Websites** for easy dashboard access and can be shared, used in reports, or included in site-wide analytics features.

## Steps to Remove a Site

If a workspace or site is no longer required, it may be erased—note that doing so will immediately discard all related content and analytics, and recovery won't be possible.

To remove a site:

1. Access **Preferences**.
2. Open **Websites**.
3. Choose the desired site slated for removal.
4. Press **Settings**.
5. Select **Remove website**.
6. Enter the site’s title to confirm deletion.
7. The final **Remove website** prompt will become available—approve it.

Once confirmed, the site and its data are deleted, along with any reporting or dashboard access linked to it.

## Instructions for Wiping Site Data

If the goal is to retain a site’s unique ID and event records but erase all gathered analytics or pageview data, perform a wipe.

To erase site data:

1. Go to **Preferences**.
2. Select **Websites**.
3. Find and choose the site to cleanse.
4. Open **Settings**.
5. Press **Clear data**.
6. Enter the site name to confirm.
7. The **Clear data** option will activate—select it to finalize.

After confirming, the site’s history and recorded data are removed, but system identifiers and event links are kept for continued organization.

## Information About Site Limits

Accounts can support a limitless number of sites; however, there is a modest additional cost for maintaining more than fifty sites. For complete details, refer to the FAQs or contact the platform’s support team for guidance.
