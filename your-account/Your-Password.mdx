title: "Security Guidance for Passwords"
---

Strong security for account access is essential. Follow these best practices:

- Set a one-of-a-kind password for this analytics account—do not reuse passwords from other services.
- Rely on reputable password management solutions, such as 1Password, to keep credentials safe.
- Activate two-factor authentication (2FA) soon after opening a new account to add an extra security layer.
- Avoid giving out or publishing your password; use dashboard sharing tools if colleagues need temporary access.

The support team will never request passwords by email—messages asking for login details should be considered suspicious. If your password is forgotten, reset it easily; if 2FA challenges arise, follow help resources dedicated to two-factor authentication.
