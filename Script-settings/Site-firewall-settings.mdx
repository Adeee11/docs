title: "Site Firewall Settings Overview"

For advanced control over site activity tracking, firewall settings empower you to exclude data from unwanted pages, addresses, domains, or countries. These exclusions are managed in the Floo Analytics dashboard:

- Navigate to **Preferences \> Websites**, select your site, and go to the **Access Control** section.
- In this area, you can block page paths, entire groups of IPs, domains, or locations.
- Visitors from excluded areas or resources will still be able to browse as normal, but their engagement will not appear in analytics reports.

To bar specific pages or use wildcards for multiple exclusions, simply add each path into the **Blocked Pages** list within your Access Control settings.This image explains how to manage analytics firewall settings, including blocking specific pages and adjusting tracking controls for IPs, domains, or countriesâ€”all accessible via the firewall tab in your dashboard.image.jpg

## Original Version: Floo Analytics Site Firewall & Controls

Analytics tracking can be selectively adjusted using firewall features within Floo Analytics. Settings for canonical URLs and privacy signals (DNT) can be found in the advanced script options, while broader access controls are managed in the dashboard.

To update access rules:

- Go to **Preferences \> Websites**, choose your site, and open the **Firewall** section.
- Block pages, entire IP ranges, domains, or countries to prevent selected visits from being counted in your dashboard analytics.

**Note:** These restrictions only affect data collection. Blocked visitors still access the site, but their actions are excluded from reports.

## Blocked Pages

Designate page URLs or patterns in the **Blocked Pages** field to filter out unwanted analytics data. Wildcard path matching is supported, allowing bulk exclusion of content as needed.
