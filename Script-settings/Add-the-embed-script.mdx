title: "Add the embed script"
---

To enable Floo Analytics on a website, simply add a script snippet to the header area, inserting your assigned site ID in place of the placeholder:

\<script src="https://cdn.flooanalytics.com/index.js" data-site="YOUR_SITE_ID"\>\</script\>

## How to Generate or Locate Your Tracking Code

- Sign in to Floo Analytics.
- Navigate to **Preferences \> Websites.**
- For a new site, enter your site name under **Add Website**, assign it a label, and save it. Copy the provided embed code and paste it into your site’s `<head>` section.
- For an existing property, select its name, find the embed code under the **Integration** tab, and add it to your site’s header.

After installation, confirm the script is working properly using the built-in verification tool in your Floo Analytics dashboard.

## Site Protection Settings

Explore firewall options to manage access by blocking specific pages, IP addresses, regions, or entire domains for enhanced security and control.

## Advanced Analytics Integration

Learn about sophisticated script adjustments, such as ignoring canonical tags, respecting Do Not Track signals, and supporting single-page applications. For WordPress and other platforms, refer to integration instructions—if your site’s system isn’t covered, manually place the analytics code in the header or template.
