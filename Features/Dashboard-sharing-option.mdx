title: "Dashboard sharing option"
---

By default, only the Floo Analytics account holder can view their dashboard. To make stats accessible to others, adjust sharing settings in your site options under **Preferences \> Dashboard Sharing**.

## Dashboard Sharing Modes

1. **Private:** The default—only the owner can access the dashboard.
2. **Passworded:** Generate a private share URL and set a password. Anyone with both can view a “read-only” dashboard, but they cannot edit, create, or delete anything. The password can be changed at any time to restrict previous access.
3. **Public (no password):** The dashboard becomes visible to anyone with the direct share link, ideal for making public stats or offering open transparency.

User account features for more granular access and permissions are in development for future updates.

You can update the visibility of your Floo Analytics dashboard at any time, toggling between private, password-protected, or public access to suit your needs.

## How to Hide the Dashboard Sharing Banner

If you prefer not to show the Floo Analytics promotional banner on dashboards shared with others, simply go to **Preferences \> Account**, locate the sharing banner option, and set it to **Hidden**. This ensures a clean, branded viewing experience for anyone accessing your shared analytics.

## Passwordless Shared Dashboard URL Steps

1. **Set dashboard sharing to “Passworded”** in your Floo Analytics dashboard settings.
2. **Hash your dashboard password.** For example, if your password is `badpassword`, generate its SHA256 hash using a tool such as md5decrypt.net.
   - Example SHA256 hash:

     ```
     text
     3693d93220b28a03d3c70bdc1cab2b890c65a2e6baff3d4a2a651b713c161c5c 
     ```
3. **Get your dashboard’s share URL.** It will look like:

   ```
   text
   https://app.flooanalytics.com/share/random/your-site-name 
   ```

   Replace `random` and `your-site-name` with your actual dashboard values.
4. **Append the password hash as a query string:**

   ```
   text
   ?password=3693d93220b28a03d3c70bdc1cab2b890c65a2e6baff3d4a2a651b713c161c5c 
   ```
5. **Resulting link:**

   ```
   text
   https://app.flooanalytics.com/share/random/your-site-name?password=3693d93220b28a03d3c70bdc1cab2b890c65a2e6baff3d4a2a651b713c161c5c 
   ```

   **Important:**

- This approach only works for dashboard sharing because the password is checked as plain text for this use—not for secure user authentication.
- Swap in your actual password’s SHA256 hash, and use the correct Share URL for your specific dashboard.
