title: "Multi Domain Tracking "
---

Floo Analytics allows users to track multiple domains and subdomains with one dashboard and filter data for each domain independently. Activate multi-domain support at the site level via **Preferences \> Websites**, selecting the relevant site and turning on the **Multiple Domains** setting.

Once enabled, a **Domains** tab appears on your dashboard, listing all associated domains. Selecting any domain from this list filters the entire dashboard—so analytics for referrers, devices, and more will update to display only data specific to that chosen domain. This helps precisely monitor traffic patterns and performance across all managed properties.

## Multi-Domain Options in Floo Analytics

When multi-domain tracking is enabled in Floo Analytics, choose between two modes for attributing visits:

## Combined Mode

- All visits across your domains (including subdomains) are tracked as a single user session.
- Example: If someone visits [cat.com](http://cat.com), then [shop.cat.com](http://shop.cat.com) and [docs.cat.com](http://docs.cat.com), they are counted once as a visitor with multiple page views; the original landing domain is used for attribution.
- Best for businesses with multiple entry points—such as a marketing site, customer portal, and documentation—all considered as parts of one cohesive site but with filterable data by domain.

## Separate Mode

- Each domain is treated as its own site for counting visits, so a user visiting multiple domains is reported as a new visitor on each.

These options allow Floo Analytics users to tailor reporting for their specific network of domains, ensuring accurate traffic segmentation and visitor analysis.

With Floo Analytics' "Separate" option activated, every unique domain visit is tracked individually. For instance, if a visitor goes from [cat.com](http://cat.com) to [luna.cat.com](http://luna.cat.com) and [olii.cat.com](http://olii.cat.com), each domain session is registered as a distinct visit, not a single journey.

This is especially effective for multi-tenant platforms, where customers each use their own custom domain. In this mode, analytics clearly differentiate activity across each domain and attribute visits separately for detailed tenant-level insight.
