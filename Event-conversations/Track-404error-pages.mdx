title: "Track 404/error pages"
---

When someone lands on a 404 or error page, use a dynamic event like:

- `"404: /some-missing-url"`

This setup allows you to see which invalid URLs users are attempting to visit. For example, if a user tries to visit `/poodcast` (a misspelled podcast page), `an`event named `404: /poodcast` would be logged.

This information is valuable for finding and fixing broken links or adding helpful redirects on your site.

## 1. Detect 404 via Template Page

Add this script to the footer of your 404 template:

```
javascript
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
  const path = window.location.pathname;
  floo.trackEvent('404: ' + path);
});
```

This records an event named `404: /broken-path` whenever the 404 template loads.image.jpg

## 2. Detect 404 via Page Title

If your 404 page is recognized by its `<title>`, use:

```
javascript
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
  const title = document.title;
  if (title.includes('404') || title.includes('Page Not Found')) {
    floo.trackEvent('404: ' + window.location.pathname);
  }
});
```

This logs a 404 event only when the tab title indicates a "404" or "Page Not Found" error, helpful for multi-purpose error pages.image.jpg

Both scripts ensure robust detection and reporting of user visits to missing pages.
