title: "Tracking Link Clicks "
---
## 1. Inline HTML Method
Add an `onclick` handler directly to your anchor (`<a>`) tag:
```
xml
<a href="/about" onclick="floo.trackEvent('button click');">About Us</a>
```
This captures every click on that link as a “button click” event.
## 2. JavaScript ID-Based Method
Assign an ID to your link and use JavaScript to bind the event after the page loads:
```
xml
<a href="/about" id="about-us-link">About us</a>
<script>
  window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    document.getElementById('about-us-link').addEventListener('click', () => {
      floo.trackEvent('about click');
    });
  });
</script>
```
Change both the ID and the event name as needed.
## 3. JavaScript Class-Based Method (Not shown, but implied for multiple elements)
If tracking multiple links with a common class, use JavaScript to target the class and loop over elements.
These methods let Floo Analytics capture and report on link clicks granularly, for any part of a site.\
Tracking Multiple Download Link Clicks by Class in Floo Analytics
Assign a common class (e.g., `.download-link`) to all download anchors:
```
xml
<a href="file1.pdf" class="download-link">File 1</a>
<a href="file2.pdf" class="download-link">File 2</a>
<a href="file3.pdf" class="download-link">File 3</a>
```
Add a script that loops through each element with the download-link class and tracks a shared event:
```
javascript
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
  document.querySelectorAll('.download-link').forEach(item => {
    item.addEventListener('click', () => {
      floo.trackEvent('file download');
    });
  });
});
```
- `.download-link` This is the class selector for all download links.
- `"file download"` Is the event name shown in the dashboard?
You can further modify this code to record distinct event names for each file if more granular reporting is needed.
