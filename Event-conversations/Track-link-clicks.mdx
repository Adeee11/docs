title: "Tracking Link Clicks "

## 1. Inline HTML Method

Add an `onclick` handler directly to your anchor (`<a>`) tag:

```
xml
<a href="/about" onclick="floo.trackEvent('button click');">About Us</a>
```

This captures every click on that link as a “button click” event.

## 2. JavaScript ID-Based Method

Assign an ID to your link and use JavaScript to bind the event after the page loads:

```
xml
<a href="/about" id="about-us-link">About us</a>
<script>
  window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    document.getElementById('about-us-link').addEventListener('click', () => {
      floo.trackEvent('about click');
    });
  });
</script>
```

Change both the ID and the event name as needed.

## 3. JavaScript Class-Based Method (Not shown, but implied for multiple elements)

If tracking multiple links with a common class, use JavaScript to target the class and loop over elements.
These methods let Floo Analytics capture and report on link clicks granularly, for any part of a site.\
Tracking Multiple Download Link Clicks by Class in Floo Analytics: Assign a common class (e.g., `.download-link`) to all download anchors:

```
xml
<a href="file1.pdf" class="download-link">File 1</a>
<a href="file2.pdf" class="download-link">File 2</a>
<a href="file3.pdf" class="download-link">File 3</a>
```

Add a script that loops through each element with the download-link class and tracks a shared event:

```
javascript
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
  document.querySelectorAll('.download-link').forEach(item => {
    item.addEventListener('click', () => {
      floo.trackEvent('file download');
    });
  });
});
```

- `.download-link` This is the class selector for all download links.
- `"file download"` Is the event name shown in the dashboard?
  You can further modify this code to record distinct event names for each file if more granular reporting is needed.

## Dynamic Analytics Event Tracking for File Downloads

Use this script to track which file is downloaded on each click, pulling dynamic info from the link:

```
javascript
window.addEventListener('load', (event) => {
  document.querySelectorAll('.download-link').forEach(item => {
    item.addEventListener('click', event => {
      let fileName = item.getAttribute('href');
      floo.trackEvent(`file download: ${fileName}`);
    });
  });
});
```

- This records an event with the file’s URL as part of the event name.

**Privacy Tip:**\
Instead of embedding the full file path, add a custom attribute like `data-filename="File X"` to each link and then use:

```
javascript
let fileName = item.getAttribute('data-filename'); 
```

This ensures only the intended label (not the URL) is tracked in analytics events.
