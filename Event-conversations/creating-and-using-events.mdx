As of October 25, 2023, the legacy `trackGoal` function is deprecated for new goals/events in Floo Analytics. Existing uses of `trackGoal` will still work, but all new event tracking should follow the updated approach.

## How Events Work

Events (goals/conversions) let you track user actions—like button clicks, form submissions, newsletter sign-ups, or e-commerce purchases. To define an event, you must:

1. Provide the **event name** as a required field in your event tracking code.
2. Optionally, add extra information using an options object (currently, only `_value` Passing a numeric value is supported.

**Technical Note:**\
Make sure the Floo Analytics tracking script is loaded before firing event code, and always use HTTP/HTTPS (events are not tracked locally).

## Tracking Event Types and Naming Conventions 

Floo Analytics allows users to track a variety of events and conversions, including:

- Link clicks (internal and external)
- Page load conversions
- 404/error page visits
- E-commerce conversions (purchases, sign-ups, etc.)
- Form submissions

## Event Naming Rules

Event names can be chosen freely, but it is recommended to:

- Avoid special characters and emojis in event names.
- Use clear, descriptive names that are easy for the team to recognize and understand in reports.

This helps maintain clarity in analytics and ensures everyone knows exactly what each tracked event represents.

## Example Code for Tracking Events 

To track a custom event with a value (such as an e-commerce cart addition), use:

```
javascript
floo.trackEvent('cart add', {   value: 100 // Value in cents }); 
```

For a simple event without any associated value (such as a newsletter signup), use:

```
javascript
floo.trackEvent('newsletter signup'); 
```

Replace the function name (`floo.trackEvent`) with the correct API if using another analytics platform, and always use clear, descriptive event names.

## Adjusting Conversion Rate Calculation

Floo Analytics allows each site to define how its conversion rate is measured. In the dashboard, navigate to:

- **Settings → [Your Site Name] → Event Conversion Formula**

By default, conversions are calculated as:

```
text
Event completions / total Page views 
```

If preferred, switch to a people-based calculation:

```
text
Event completions / total People 
```

This provides flexibility to align conversion metrics with site goals, choosing either a visit-focused or unique visitor-focused approach.

## Deleting and Blocking Events in Floo Analytics

To remove an event and its data in Floo Analytics, you have two options:

- **Delete:** Permanently deletes the event and all collected data for it.
- **Delete and block:** Deletes the event data and stops any future data collection for that event name. You can later unblock the event, but previously deleted data won’t be restored.

Access these controls by:

1. Go to the dashboard and scroll to the Events section.
2. Clicking **Manage events**.
3. Finding the desired event, clicking the **ellipsis** button, and choosing **Delete** or **Delete and block**.

If necessary, unblock an event later via the “Blocked Events” section at the bottom of the Event settings page.
