title: "Track page load conversions"
---

To record an event when a certain page loads, add this script to the page:

```
javascript
window.addEventListener('load', (event) => {   
floo.trackEvent('checkout completed'); }); 
```

Replace `'checkout completed'` with an event name relevant to the specific conversion or milestone. The event will be reported in analytics whenever a visitor loads that page.
