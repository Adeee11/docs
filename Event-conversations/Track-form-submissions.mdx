title: "Tracking Form Submission Conversions"

## 1. Using the form's HTML directly

Add an `onsubmit` handler:

```
xml
<form method="post" onsubmit="floo.trackEvent('form submit');"> 
```

Replace `'form submit'` with a descriptive event name for your analytics dashboard.

## 2. Using JavaScript for forms with IDs

If you can't edit the HTML directly, but the form has an ID:

```
javascript
window.addEventListener('load', (event) => {
  document.getElementById('id-of-your-form').addEventListener('submit', () => {
    floo.trackEvent('form submit');
  });
});
```

Change `'id-of-your-form'` and the event name as needed.

Both methods will allow you to monitor submitted forms as tracked events in your dashboard.
