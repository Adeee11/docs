## Additional Dashboard Features for Floo Analytics

- **Time Zones**: Floo Analytics collects site data in UTC\+0 and then adjusts your dashboard view to match the local timezone for accurate tracking. The system resets unique visitor metrics at midnight UTC\+0 for consistent daily analytics.
- **Changing the Graph**: Users can customize dashboard graphs by clicking any metric in the summary box—such as visitors, views, session time, bounce rate, or event completions—to show or hide individual data lines and focus on what’s important.
- **Dark Mode**: Floo Analytics dashboards automatically adapt to your website’s visual theme, displaying in either light or dark mode. Users can adjust this preference at any time through their account settings, making the analytics experience more comfortable and accessible.

## Viewing Dashboard Details

- Clicking the icon at the bottom left of any dashboard tile reveals additional insights for that metric. Each details view displays up to 50 data rows per page, with sections such as Pages offering advanced breakdowns—like bounce rate or average session time per page—for deeper analysis.

## Definition of a Visitor

- A "visitor" is recognized as a distinct user who comes to your website—regardless of the number of pages viewed. Floo Analytics maintains privacy by resetting visitor identifiers every 24 hours, ensuring that data remains anonymized while keeping reporting accurate and actionable.

## What Are Views?

In Floo Analytics, a **view** records every instance a page is loaded on a site—regardless of who is visiting. For example, if two visitors each browse three unique pages, that results in six views total. Views are a key metric for site performance and are used to determine resource usage and plan selection.

## How Is Average Time on Page Measured?

Average time on a page is calculated based on the interval between one page click and the next. If a visitor lands on the homepage and clicks another page two minutes later, their time on the homepage is measured as two minutes. This approach provides a clear picture of user engagement, but doesn’t log time spent on the final page of a visit since another click isn’t registered.

## Bounce Rate Calculation

Bounce rate in Floo Analytics measures the percentage of sessions where users leave after viewing only a single page. It’s determined by dividing the number of single-page sessions by the total number of sessions. For example, if half of your visitors exit after visiting just one page, your bounce rate would be 50%.

## Event Metrics

Events encompass interactions beyond simple page views—like button clicks, form completions, and e-commerce activities. Floo Analytics calculates event conversion by comparing the number of event triggers to total page views. Additionally, unique event completions capture the count of distinct visitors who achieve a specific goal, ensuring metrics reflect genuine user engagement.

## Interpreting Realtime Metrics

**People on your site**: This shows the count of users actively browsing your website at any given moment. Clicking the number reveals more details about which pages are currently being viewed and the referrers for each visitor.

## Understanding Direct/Unknown Traffic

**Direct/unknown** in the Referrers report indicates visitors who accessed your site without an identifiable referring source. This may mean they typed your URL directly, arrived from an email or app, or that their session lacked a referrer field for technical reasons.image.jpg

Data for directs/unknowns is only available from March 18, 2021, onward, so historical comparisons should factor in this recording start date when analyzing older reports.

These metrics help users distinguish between engaged, live site visitors and understand the source of incoming website traffic for more accurate interpretation.

## What is a “ref” Parameter?

A “ref” parameter in a web address signals the origin or referring source of a website visitor, helping analytics platforms attribute traffic to the right campaigns or external links. For instance, URLs like landingpage.com/?ref=mysite use this tag to indicate that a visit originated from a specific promotion, social network, email, or external website.image.jpg

By tracking ref parameters, Floo Analytics enables accurate measurement of which channels, campaigns, or referring sites are driving visitor traffic and conversions.
