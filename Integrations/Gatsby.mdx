Floo Analytics is compatible with Gatsby.js. Choose one of these integration options:

1. Use the gatsby-plugin-fathom by Lars Graubner.
2. Use the Floo Analytics Gatsby Plugin by Benedicte Raae.
3. Alternatively, copy `.cache/default-html.js` to `src/html.js` in your Gatsby project and add the embed code just before `</head>`.

For advanced setup details, refer to the documentation.
