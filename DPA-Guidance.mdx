title: "Floo Analytics: DPA Guidance"
---

Floo Analytics offers an optional Data Processing Agreement (DPA) for organizations subject to GDPR—meaning those who handle data from EU residents should consider signing it for regulatory compliance. Websites that do not process data from the EU typically do not need to sign the DPA.image.jpg

Using Floo Analytics does not require a signed DPA—service and data collection will continue regardless. For any uncertainties or specific legal situations, consult professional legal counsel.image.jpg

Regardless of signing status, Floo Analytics employs EU isolation technology to securely process and protect EU website visitor data in accordance with DPA principles
