To begin collecting insights with Floo Analytics, add the tracking script to your website’s header—this can be done manually or through a supported plugin or integration. For WordPress sites, use the dedicated plugin; other platforms may leverage easy-to-configure integrations.

Floo Analytics provides a live dashboard: visit your own site and confirm your visit displays in the “Active Visitors” section to ensure successful script setup.

If data isn’t appearing or results seem inaccurate, check troubleshooting resources or integration guides for fast resolution and optimal performance.
