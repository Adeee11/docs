## GDPR and Consent Banners

The purpose of the GDPR is to protect EU citizens’ privacy, and this platform is designed with that core principle in mind.

There’s a valid legal basis for all data processing activities. Privacy risk assessments are conducted whenever major changes are made, such as briefly storing redacted IP address logs for security incidents like DDoS attacks.

Key GDPR points include:

1. Personal data (such as IP addresses and user-agents) is processed on your behalf.
2. Pseudo-anonymized data is retained for roughly 48 hours—after which critical information is deleted, making it virtually impossible for anyone to reverse-engineer the data.
