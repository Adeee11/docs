---

Switching from Google Analytics to another analytics tool, such as Fathom Analytics, will not negatively influence your websiteâ€™s SEO performance. Your search rankings remain unaffected if you use an alternative analytics solution.

For a deeper dive, check the comprehensive article linked to this topic.

Because the Fathom Analytics script is lightweight and distributed via a global CDN, it helps your website load faster, which can be beneficial for SEO.

If you see issues reported by page speed tools, these may stem from the analytics script blocking automated bot traffic (like crawlers used for speed testing), not from actual SEO problems.
