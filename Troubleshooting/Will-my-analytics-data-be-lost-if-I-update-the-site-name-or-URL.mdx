title: "Will my analytics data be lost if I update the site name or URL?"

You can change your dashboard’s site name in your analytics account whenever needed—this won’t affect your Site ID or require any changes to your tracking script.

Similarly, updating your website’s URL will not cause any loss of previously collected stats, provided you don’t remove the site from your analytics platform.
