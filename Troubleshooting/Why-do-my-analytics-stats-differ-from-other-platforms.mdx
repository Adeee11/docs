title: "Why do my analytics stats differ from other platforms?"
---

When comparing stats between Floo Analytics and other analytics tools, expect some differencesâ€”not because either is faulty, but for several reasons:

1. Visitor tracking varies: Ad blockers and certain browsers might block some analytics scripts.
2. Unique visitor calculations differ: For instance, Floo resets uniques daily for privacy, while others may use alternative methods.
3. Time-on-page can be measured differently: Floo Analytics calculates this by checking the time between consecutive page views.
4. Both analytics tools must be installed on exactly the same pages and compared over the same time periods for results to match.
5. Bots and crawlers are handled differently: Floo Analytics automatically filters out nearly all bots for cleaner data, while some platforms like Google Analytics might allow unwanted bot activity unless extensive filters are set, which can lead to dashboard spam.

## Can Floo Analytics and Google Analytics be used at the same time?

Yes, it's completely possible to run Floo Analytics alongside Google Analytics or any other analytics tool. Be aware, though, that the statistics you receive from each service might differ.

However, it's advised to discontinue sending visitor data to Google Analytics promptly, since its use has been ruled illegal in certain jurisdictions.
