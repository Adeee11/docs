title: "Why are UTM parameters I didn’t create appearing?"
---

Anyone can generate a UTM campaign and link to your website, so UTM parameters may turn up in your dashboard even if you never set them up yourself. For instance, if another site links to yours using a UTM-tagged URL, those parameters will show in your analytics as part of campaign and referral tracking.

This means UTM data can appear in your reports simply because someone else is sharing links to your site with UTMs—not because you created those campaigns.
