If a feature isn’t listed on the website or in the support resources, it doesn’t exist—every available capability is fully documented and nothing is hidden.

New features are frequently introduced, and existing ones are improved. Details on what’s currently available can be found in the platform’s feature list, roadmap, and changelog. All customers receive new features at the same time, so there’s no need to inquire about launch dates—updates are designed to be a pleasant surprise for everyone.
